#Welcome!
###Thanks for visiting my blog!
####About Reno777.tech

So a little about this website:

Basically this is a blog of all my research and projects that I work on. I thought this would be a good idea not only to show what I do in my spare time, but also to provide information to
people that need it. I have found in many of my projects that I end up looking into serveral different sites and guides for said project. This website is mainly to bring all of those
sites and guide together into one place so that it is more stream lined and easier for users to find what they need and to save time doing it. I cant tell you how much time has been
spent on hosting this simple website by looking around at different guides every time something went wrong. I hope that this guide helps out anyone who needs it. If there are any questions for
me or something that needs to be fixed please refer to the Contact section to the right. --->

Update Mar 06, 2017 @ 9 pm -- Please excuse some of my posts that are not completed. I will be working to get them done as soon as I can, however I have decided to take up the project of making my own
Linux distribution. You can find out more information about this project here.

Thank you

~Reno
