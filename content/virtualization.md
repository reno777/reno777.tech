#Virtualization Using Vsphere

This is another research subject that I am following. Again I am trying to get this page up and running. To get you started I am following
> Mastering VMware VSphere 6  
By: Nick Marshall. 

I would highly recommend this book, and if you end up getting it you can follow along with this post on it.

Again thank you for your patience.
